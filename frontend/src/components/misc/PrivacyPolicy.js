            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>
              Pursu is a productivity enhancement tool designed to help you
              streamline and get the most out of your tech recruiting journey.
            </p>

            <h1>Data We Request</h1>
            <p>
              We collect a variety of information about our users when you
              provide it to us as well as when you use our services. This
              personal data is aggregated and anonymized to ensure our usersâ€™
              privacy and security. This data falls into the following
              categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Identity data:</strong> This is optional information
                  you provide to us when signing up and includes your
                  university, graduation year, and major.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Email data:</strong> Pursu uses email information for
                  the overall benefit of our users. We scrape your emails and
                  run them through a proprietary algorithm to determine which
                  are related to recruiting. We remove any identifying
                  information from these emails and utilize valuable components,
                  including subject line, date, sender, and the email body. This
                  information is used to power your personal recruiting
                  dashboard and the core of our product. If a user gives us
                  explicit consent while signing up, we will remove all
                  identifiable material from the email subject and body, and
                  store this in our database to improve the accuracy of our
                  algorithm moving forward.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage/Technical Data:</strong> Finally, our product
                contains technologies from third party providers of analytics,
                which helps us compile statistics about our products and
                services and how users engage with them, to ultimately improve
                our offering. We prohibit these analytics providers from
                accessing directly or indirectly identifiable information about
                you.
